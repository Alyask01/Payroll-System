# Payroll-System

"Payroll-System" is a Java project that demonstrates my ability to create an application for managing employee payroll information. The application is able to calculate employee pay based on hourly, salary, or commission rates and allows employers to save up to three employees.

Getting Started
To run the application, simply clone the repository to your local machine and open the project in your preferred Java IDE. Once the project is open, you can run the PayrollSystemUI class to launch the application.

Usage
When the application launches, you will be prompted to input employee data such as employee ID, name, and pay type. The application will then calculate the employee's gross pay, taxes, and net pay based on the input data. You can save up to three employees and view their information at any time.

Technologies Used
This project was built using Java, specifically using object-oriented programming features.
